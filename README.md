My favorite leet code questions and my answers

I have solved several questions from leetcode, however some of them piqued my interest. I have posted them here.

Some realisation I met while solving questions, if you write the question down, break it into sub parts, similiar to didvide and conquer stratergy, the question becomes solvable very easily, as its easier to visualize and come up with the suitable answer.
